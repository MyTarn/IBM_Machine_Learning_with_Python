## Hands-on Assignment: Classification of Loan dataset

Instruction
- Complete a notebook where you will build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.
- Load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data.
- Use the following algorithms to build models:
  1. k-Nearest Neighbour
  2. Decision Tree
  3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  4. Logistic Regression
- The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:
  1. Jaccard index
  2. F1-score
  3. LogLoss
